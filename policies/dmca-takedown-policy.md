# DMCA Takedown Policy

[Ocean Market](https://market.oceanprotocol.com) is a decentralized data marketplace operated by [Ocean Protocol Foundation](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) (OPF).

Welcome to the Ocean Market Guide to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, commonly known as the "DMCA." It's adapted from [GitHub's Policy](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/content/github/site-policy/dmca-takedown-policy.md) for OPF. This page is not meant as a comprehensive primer to the statute. However, if you've received a DMCA takedown notice targeting content you've posted on Ocean Market or if you're a rights-holder looking to issue such a notice, this page will hopefully help to demystify the law a bit as well as our policies for complying with it.

(If you just want to submit a notice, you can [skip to the end](#f-submitting-notices).)

As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation. We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights. This guide isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such.

### What Is the DMCA?

In order to understand the DMCA and some of the policy lines it draws, it's perhaps helpful to consider life before it was enacted.

The DMCA provides a safe harbor for service providers that host user-generated content. Since even a single claim of copyright infringement can carry statutory damages of up to $150,000, the possibility of being held liable for user-generated content could be very harmful for service providers. With potential damages multiplied across millions of users, cloud-computing and user-generated content sites like YouTube, Facebook, or Ocean Market probably [never would have existed](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/04/how-the-dmca-made-youtube/) without the DMCA (or at least not without passing some of that cost downstream to their users).

The DMCA addresses this issue by creating a [copyright liability safe harbor](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512) for internet service providers hosting allegedly infringing user-generated content. Essentially, so long as a service provider follows the DMCA's notice-and-takedown rules, it won't be liable for copyright infringement based on user-generated content. Because of this, it is important for Ocean Market to maintain its DMCA safe-harbor status.

### DMCA Notices In a Nutshell

The DMCA provides two simple, straightforward procedures that all Ocean Market users should know about: (i) a [takedown-notice](guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice) procedure for copyright holders to request that content be removed; and (ii) a [counter-notice](guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice) procedure for users to get content reenabled when content is taken down by mistake or misidentification.

DMCA takedown notices are used by copyright owners to ask OPF to take down content they believe to be infringing. If you are a software designer or developer, you create copyrighted content every day. The same is true for many other professions. If someone else is using your copyrighted content in an unauthorized manner on Ocean Market, you can send us a DMCA takedown notice to request that the infringing content be changed or removed.

On the other hand, counter notices can be used to correct mistakes. Maybe the person sending the takedown notice does not hold the copyright or did not realize that you have a license or made some other mistake in their takedown notice. Since Ocean Market usually cannot know if there has been a mistake, the DMCA counter notice allows you to let us know and ask that we put the content back up.

The DMCA notice and takedown process should be used only for complaints about copyright infringement. Notices sent through our DMCA process must identify copyrighted work or works that are allegedly being infringed. The process cannot be used for other complaints, such as complaints about alleged [trademark infringement](ocean-market-trademark-policy.md) or [sensitive data](ocean-market-sensitive-data-removal-policy.md); we offer separate processes for those situations.

### A. How Does This Actually Work?

The DMCA framework is a bit like passing notes in class. The copyright owner hands OPF a complaint about a user. If it's written correctly, we pass the complaint along to the user. If the user disputes the complaint, they can pass a note back saying so. Ocean Market exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury.

Here are the basic steps in the process.

1. **Copyright Owner Investigates.** A copyright owner should always conduct an initial investigation to confirm both (a) that they own the copyright to an original work and (b) that the content on Ocean Market is unauthorized and infringing. This includes confirming that the use is not protected as [fair use](https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22). A particular use may be fair if it only uses a small amount of copyrighted content, uses that content in a transformative way, uses it for educational purposes, or some combination of the above. Because code naturally lends itself to such uses, each use case is different and must be considered separately.
> **Example:** An employee of Acme Web Company finds some of the company's IP in Ocean Market. Acme Web Company licenses its IP out to several trusted partners. Before sending in a take-down notice, Acme should review those licenses and its agreements to confirm that the IP on Ocean Market is not authorized under any of them.

2. **Copyright Owner Sends A Notice.** After conducting an investigation, a copyright owner prepares and sends a takedown notice to OPF. Assuming the takedown notice is sufficiently detailed according to the statutory requirements (as explained in the [how-to guide](guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice.md), we will [post the notice](#d-transparency) to our [public repository](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dmca) and pass the link along to the affected user.

3. **OPF Places the Item into Ocean Market Purgatory Process.** This affects how the asset is displayed, and restricts actions on it in Ocean Market. [Details are here](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/policies/README.md). The Process includes paths to exit the purgatory process.



### D. Transparency

We believe that transparency is a virtue. The public should know what content is being removed from Ocean Market and why. An informed public can notice and surface potential issues that would otherwise go unnoticed in an opaque system. We post redacted copies of any legal notices we receive (including original notices, counter notices or retractions) at <https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dmca>. We will not publicly publish your personal contact information; we will remove personal information (except for usernames in URLs) before publishing notices. We will not, however, redact any other information from your notice unless you specifically ask us to. Here are some examples of a published notices for GitHub Inc: [notice](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2014/2014-05-28-Delicious-Brains.md) and [counter notice](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2014/2014-05-01-Pushwoosh-SDK-counternotice.md) for you to see what they look like. When we remove content, we will post a link to the related notice in its place.

Please also note that, although we will not publicly publish unredacted notices, we may provide a complete unredacted copy of any notices we receive directly to any party whose rights would be affected by it.

### E. Repeated Infringement

It is the policy of OPF, in appropriate circumstances and in its sole discretion, to blacklist particular accounts of users (Ethereum addresses) who may infringe upon the copyrights or other intellectual property rights in Ocean Market.

### Learn More and Speak Up

If you poke around the Internet, it is not too hard to find commentary and criticism about the copyright system in general and the DMCA in particular. While OPF acknowledges and appreciates the important role that the DMCA has played in promoting innovation online, we believe that the copyright laws could probably use a patch or twoâ€”if not a whole new release. In software, we are constantly improving and updating our code. Think about how much technology has changed since 1998 when the DMCA was written. Doesn't it just make sense to update these laws that apply to software?

We don't presume to have all the answers. But if you are curious, here are a few links to scholarly articles and blog posts we have found with opinions and proposals for reform:

OPF doesn't necessarily endorse any of the viewpoints in those articles. We provide the links to encourage you to learn more, form your own opinions, and then reach out to your elected representative(s) (in Singapore, in the [U.S. Congress](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members) or [E.U. Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home)) to seek whatever changes you think should be made.

OPF reserves the right to change this policy on an ad-hoc basis, always according to core principles of fairness and transparency.
