# Ocean Market Sensitive Data Removal Policy

[Ocean Market](https://market.oceanprotocol.com) is a decentralized data marketplace operated by [Ocean Protocol Foundation](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) (OPF).

If you believe that content on Ocean Market infringes a valid copyright you own, please see our "DMCA Takedown Policy" and our "Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice". We rely on the DMCA notice and takedown process for the majority of our removal actions.

However, we understand that sensitive, security-related content may get published on Ocean Market – whether accidentally or on purpose – from time to time. We provide our sensitive data removal process to remove this sensitive data in certain exceptional circumstances where the DMCA process would not be applicable, such as when your security is at risk from exposed passwords and you do not own the copyright to the specific content that you need removed, or the content is not protectable by copyright. This guide describes the information that OPF  needs from you in order to process a request to remove sensitive data.

### What is Sensitive Data?

For the purposes of this document, “sensitive data” refers to content that (i) should have been kept confidential, *and* (ii) whose public availability poses a specific or targeted security risk to you or your organization.

#### Sensitive data removal requests are appropriate for:
- Access credentials, such as user names combined with passwords, access tokens, or other sensitive secrets that can grant access to your organization's server, network, or domain.
- AWS tokens and other similar access credentials that grant access to a third party on your behalf. You must be able to show that the token does belong to you.
- Documentation (such as network diagrams) that poses a specific security risk for an organization. Internal server names, IP addresses, and URLs, on their own, are not sufficiently sensitive; you must be able to show that the internal server name's use in a particular file or piece of code poses a security threat.

#### Sensitive data removal requests are _not_ appropriate for:
-  Requests to remove content that may infringe your or your organization's copyright rights. If you have questions about how Ocean Market handles copyright-related matters or would like to report potentially infringing content, please review our "DMCA Takedown Policy". The sensitive data removal process is generally not intended for the removal of full files — only for the specific pieces of sensitive data in those files. While there may be cases where files are filled entirely with sensitive information, you must justify the security risk for the removal of such files, and this may increase the time required to process your request.
- Trademark disputes. If you have questions about how Ocean Market handles trademark-related matters or would like to report content containing your organization's trade or service marks, please review our "Trademark Policy".
- Mere mentions of your company's identity, name, brand, domain name, or other references to your company in files on Ocean Market. You must be able to articulate why a use of your company's identity is a threat to your company's security posture before we will take action under this policy.
- Privacy complaints. If you have concerns about your own privacy or you are contacting us on behalf of your employees due to a privacy concern — for example, if there are private email addresses or other personal information posted — please contact us via the contact info at [Ocean Protocol privacy page](https://oceanprotocol.com/privacy).
- Entire files that do not pose a specific security risk, but you believe are otherwise objectionable.

### Things to Know

**No Bots.** You should have a trained professional evaluate the facts of every request you send. If you're outsourcing your efforts to a third party, make sure you know how they operate, and make sure they are not using automated bots to submit complaints in bulk. These complaints often include data that does not pose any security threats, and they do not include sufficient explanations, requiring additional back-and-forth and resulting in delays, even when the complaint is valid.

**Send In The Correct Request.** We offer this sensitive data removal process as an exceptional service only for high-risk content. We are not able to use this process to remove other kinds of content, such as potentially infringing content, and we are not able to process any other kinds of removal requests simultaneously while processing sensitive removal requests. We will be able to help you more quickly if you send in your sensitive data removal requests separately from any requests to remove potentially infringing content. If you are unsure whether your request involves only sensitive data or also involves other legal matters, please consult legal counsel.

**Processing Time.** While we do process sensitive data removal requests as quickly as possible, it may take some time for your request to be reviewed. Additional requests, or multiple requests from additional points of contact, may result in delays.

**Be excellent to others.** Good advice for life. And, good advice for the whole process here:)

### How Does This Actually Work?

1. **Complainant Investigates.** It is up to the requesting party to conduct their own investigation and to provide us with the [details we require](#your-request-must-include) — most importantly, an explanation of how the data poses a security risk. Ocean Market is not in a position to search for or make initial determinations about sensitive data on any individual's or organization's behalf.

2. **Complainant Sends a Sensitive Data Removal Request.** After conducting an investigation, the complainant prepares and [sends a sensitive data removal request](#sending-a-sensitive-data-removal-request) to Ocean Market. If the request is not sufficiently detailed to demonstrate the security risk and for Ocean Market to locate the data, we will reply and ask for more information.

3. **OPF Puts Data Asset into Purgatory, or Deletes.** We will insert the asset into the Data Asset into the Purgatory Process. If there is time sensitivity or other factors, we may accelerate the usual timelines towards fully removing the asset.

  OR

4. **User May Dispute the Request.** If a user believes the content in question is not sensitive data subject to this Policy, they may dispute it. It will follow a process that roughly mirrors the DMCA process.


### Sending A Sensitive Data Removal Request

We need complaints to be as specific as possible. Please tell us exactly where to look.

These guidelines are designed to make the processing of requests to remove sensitive data as straightforward as possible.

#### Your Request Must Include:

1. A working, clickable link to each file containing sensitive data. (Note that we're not able to work from search results, examples, or screenshots.)
2. A brief description of how each item you've identified poses a security risk to you or your organization. ***It is important that you provide an explanation of how the data poses a security risk beyond merely stating that it does.***
3. If you are a third party acting as an agent for an organization facing a security risk, include a statement that you have a legal right to act on behalf of that organization.
4. OPTIONAL: Let us know if your request is particularly urgent, and why. We respond to all sensitive data removal requests as quickly as possible. However, if this request is especially time-sensitive, such as a very recent credential exposure, please explain why.

### How to Submit Your Request

You can submit your request to remove sensitive data via by email to [dmca@oceanprotocol.com](mailto:dmca@oceanprotocol.com). Please include a plain-text version of your request in the body of your message. Sending your request in an attachment may result in processing delays.

### Disputes

If you received a sensitive data removal request from us, you can dispute it by replying to our email and letting us know — in as much detail as possible — why you think the content in question is not sensitive data subject to this Policy.
