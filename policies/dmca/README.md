## What's this repo about?

Ocean Market DMCA policies are modeled on [Github's approach](https://github.com/github/dmca) to DMCA takedown notices.

Inspired  by [Lumen](https://lumendatabase.org/topics/1) (*formerly Chilling Effects*) and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/dmca), this repo contains the text of DMCA takedown notices and counter-notices we've received at OPF for Ocean Market. We publish them as they are received, with only personally identifiable information redacted.

## What does it mean if there's a notice posted here?

It only means that we received the notice on the indicated date. It does ***not*** mean that the content was unlawful or wrong. It does ***not*** mean that the user identified in the notice has done anything wrong. We don't make or imply any judgment about the merit of the claims they make. We post these notices and requests only for informational purposes.
