My name is [private] and I am an employee of PassMark Pty Ltd. A data set in your marketplace is infringing on at least one copyright owned by PassMark Pty Ltd. All information shared below is true and correct to the best of my knowledge, and I have read and understand OPF's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

It has recently come to our attention that our CPU Metadata is an available dataset on Ocean Market [Intel & AMD CPU Meta Data : Curated Daily](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:B7396dCD88686b0376F43eb1AB38667573A0B8a9), published by [0xFa0df50f64707104545473eF8E721B7159c3423D](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/search?owner=0xFa0df50f64707104545473eF8E721B7159c3423D), who is not PassMark Software Pty Ltd.

We produce and manage these datasets, built from results gathered from our PassMark PerformanceTest software. We make a range of this data publicly available as charts on our [CPU Benchmark site](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/), and license more detailed individual benchmark results in a CSV data files under strict conditions. The main restriction being that the data cannot be resold and cannot be used to reproduce the benchmark charts on our web site.  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

If you have any further questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to let me know.

Thank you.

Kind Regards
