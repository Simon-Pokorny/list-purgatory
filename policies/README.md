## What is this?

Ocean Market policies are modeled on [Github's approach](https://github.com/github/dmca) to DMCA takedown notices, and more. 

Inspired  by [Lumen](https://lumendatabase.org/topics/1) (*formerly Chilling Effects*) and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/dmca), this repo contains the text of DMCA takedown notices and counter-notices we've received at OPF for Ocean Market. We publish them as they are received, with only personally identifiable information redacted.

## Why is this?

In short, we believe that transparency on a specific and ongoing level is essential to good governance. Chilling Effects/Lumen explained it well in 2014 ([archive.org mirror; not present on their current site](https://web.archive.org/web/20140101160724/http://chillingeffects.org/#donato-if:~:text=We%20are%20excited%20about%20the%20new,its%20misuse%20to%20%22chill%22%20legitimate%20activity.)): "We are excited about the new opportunities the Internet offers individuals to express their views . . . but concerned that not everyone feels the same way. Study to date suggests that cease and desist letters often silence Internet users, whether or not their claims have legal merit." (About, ChillingEffects.org, Sept. 2014, licensed under [CC-BY-3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/)). Similarly, we post takedown notices here to document their potential to "chill" speech.

## What does it mean if there's a notice posted here?

It only means that we received the notice on the indicated date. It does ***not*** mean that the content was unlawful or wrong. It does ***not*** mean that the user identified in the notice has done anything wrong. We don't make or imply any judgment about the merit of the claims they make. We post these notices and requests only for informational purposes.

For more details, see our [DMCA policy](dmca-takedown-policy.md).

## Submitting a DMCA Notice

If you are a copyright owner wishing to submit a takedown notice, read our "DMCA Policy" and "Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice". You can submit the actual notice via [email](mailto:dmca@oceanprotocol.com).


## Responding to a DMCA Notice

If you are the owner of a data asset that's gone into the Purgatory Process ("purgatory"), you have two options:

  - Formally dispute the action by [submitting a counter notice](guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice.md). Maybe the person sending the takedown notice does not hold the copyright or did not realize that you have a license or made some other mistake in their takedown notice. If you believe your content on Ocean Market was mistakenly disabled by a DMCA takedown request, you have the right to contest the takedown by [submitting a counter notice](guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice.md). If you do, we will wait up to 14 days and then re-enable your content unless the copyright owner initiates a legal action before then.

  - Or, do nothing. This is the advisable option if you were violating IP rights.
